# LayerXDefConKit ‚Äì Chrome Extension Boilerplate

A lean Chrome Extension boilerplate built for DEF CON demos and security research.
Built with Manifest V3, powered by Webpack, this template is designed for rapid prototyping of both benign and malicious Chrome extension behavior.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is intended strictly for educational and ethical research purposes.
It must not be used to develop or distribute malicious software.
Always respect user privacy and platform policies.

## Pre-requisite

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) `v17.4.0`

### üõ†Ô∏è Installing Node.js and npm

1. **Go to https://nodejs.org**
2. **Download the LTS version**
3. **Run the installer** and follow the setup instructions

### ‚úÖ Verify Installation

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Project setup

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aviadgispan/LayerXDefConKit.git
cd LayerXDefConKit
```

- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

- Build for production

```
npm run build
```

- Start working on locally

```
npm run start
```

- Start the server (runs on port 5555)

```
npm run server
```

## Load extension in browser locally

- Turn on developer mode in (`chrome://extensions`)
  ![Turn on developer mode](images/devmode.png)

- Then click on `Load unpacked`
- Select `dist` folder inside this repo folder(It will get generated after running either `build` or `start` command)

- If you have run `start` command, you can see something like this in browser console

## üîÑ How to Verify the Server Is Working

To make sure your `server.js` is running correctly and the extension is successfully receiving a token from the server:

### 1. Start working locally

Run the following command to start the server locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

### 2. Start the server

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run server
```

### 3. Open the Chrome Extensions page

Navigate to: (`chrome://extensions`)

Find the extension named LayerXDefConKit, and click the üîÑ refresh icon:

![Chrome Extension Refresh](images/chromeExtension.png)

Each time you refresh the extension, it makes a request to the local server and receives a new token.

### 4. Verify the terminal output

After refreshing the extension, you should see output like this in your terminal:

![Terminal Output](images/terminal-server.png)

A new token will be logged every time the extension is refreshed.
If you see this behavior ‚Äî everything is working correctly ‚úÖ

## üß≠ Workshop Branches

The workshop is structured as a series of Git branches. Start at the first step and move forward ‚Äî each branch contains the solution to the previous task.
